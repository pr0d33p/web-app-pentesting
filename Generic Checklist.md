# Generic Web app Pentration Testing Checklist

## Information Gathering

- [ ] Visit, and browser the URL manually
- [ ] Use crawlers to crawl (manually) inaccessible or hidden content
- [ ] Check for leaked files such as robots.txt, sitemap.xml, .DS_Store, .env
- [ ] Check the public content of this site indexed by major search engines
- [ ] Check the differences in content obtained by different browser UAs (such as using crawler UAs to access mobile sites)
- [ ] Check the fingerprint of WEB application
- [ ] Identify the technology used
- [ ] Identify different user roles
- [ ] Identify the entry point of the application
- [ ] Identify the exposure of sensitive credentials
- [ ] Confirm the differences between different versions (eg web, mobile web, mobile app, web services)
- [ ] Identify subdomains and open ports
- [ ] Identify third-party libraries and outdated resources

## Configuration management
- [ ] Check frequently used application and admin URLs
- [ ] Check for the existence of old, backup and unreferenced files
- [ ] Check for supported HTTP methods and XST vulnerabilities
- [ ] Check handling of file suffixes
- [ ] Check for HTTP security headers
- [ ] Test non-production data in an production environment or vice-versa
- [ ] Check client code for sensitive information (like API keys, credentials, etc.)

## Secure Transmission
- [ ] Check SSL version, algorithm and key length
- [ ] Check the validity of the SSL certificate
- [ ] Check if credentials only transmit data over HTTPS
- [ ] Check if the login form only transmits data over HTTPS
- [ ] Check if the session token is only transmitted over HTTPS
- [ ] Check if HSTS is implemented

## Misc
- [ ] Test user enumeration
- [ ] Test Authentication Bypass
- [ ] Test rate-limitinf
- [ ] Test the quality of password policy
- [ ] Test the remember password feature
- [ ] Test autocomplete for password forms
- [ ] Test password reset and recovery
- [ ] Test password change process
- [ ] test captcha (if available)
- [ ] Test for multi-factor authentication
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Test HTTP cache management (eg Pragma, Expires, Max-age)
- [ ] Test the default login account
- [ ] Test User Authentication History
- [ ] Test the notification channel for account lockout and password modification success
- [ ] Test for shared schema/SSO consistency across applications
- [ ] test path traversal/ LFI/ RFI
- [ ] Test authorization bypess
- [ ] Testing vertical access control issues
- [ ] Test Access Control Level Issues
- [ ] Test authorization check missing

## Session Management
- [ ] Determine how the application manages the session (e.g. cookie tokens, tokens in urls)
- [ ] Check session cookie flags (httpOnly and secure)
- [ ] Check the return of the session cookie (path and domain)
- [ ] Check session cookie expiry date (expires and max-age)
- [ ] Check for session cookie expiration
- [ ] Check session cookie relative timeout invalidation
- [ ] Check session cookie expires after logout
- [ ] Test if a user can have multiple sessions at the same time
- [ ] Test the randomness of session cookies
- [ ] Confirm update of session token on login, role change and logout
- [ ] Testing for CSRF and Clickjacking 

## Injection
- [ ] Testing Reflected, Stored, & DOM-based XSS
- [ ] Test HTML Injection
- [ ] Test SQL Injection
- [ ] Test LDAP injection
- [ ] Test ORM injection
- [ ] Test XML injection
- [ ] Test XXE injection
- [ ] Test XPath Injection
- [ ] Test for IMAP/SMTP injection
- [ ] Test Code/command Injection
- [ ] Test Overflow (heap, stack and integer overflow)
- [ ] Test Format String
- [ ] Test HTTP Splitting/Smuggling (protocol layer)
- [ ] Test HTTP Verb Tampering
- [ ] Test Open-Redirection
- [ ] Compare client-side and server-side validation rules
- [ ] Test for NoSQL injection
- [ ] Testing for HTTP parameter pollution
- [ ] Test auto-binding
- [ ] Test Mass Assignment
- [ ] Test for NULL/Invalid Session Cookie

## Denial of Service (DoS)
- [ ] Test Anti-Automation/Machine Requests
- [ ] test account lockout
- [ ] Test HTTP protocol DoS
- [ ] Test SQL wildcard DoS/sleep Dos

## Business logic Flaws
- [ ] Test function abuse
- [ ] Test for lack of non-repudiation (asymmetric encryption)
- [ ] Test data integrity

## Cryptography
- [ ] Check if the data that should be encrypted is encrypted
- [ ] Check if the wrong algorithm is used depending on the context
- [ ] Check using weak algorithms
- [ ] Check for proper use of salt

## File upload
- [ ] Check if acceptable file types are in the whitelist
- [ ] Check thresholds and limits for file size limits, upload frequency, and total number of files
- [ ] Check if the file content matches the defined file type
- [ ] Check that all uploaded files are scanned by antivirus software
- [ ] Check if unsafe filenames are handled properly
- [ ] Check that the uploaded file cannot be directly accessed from the web root directory
- [ ] Check if uploaded files are stored on the same host
- [ ] Checking files and other media inherits authentication and authorization features

## Risk Function
- [ ] Test web servers or applications for known vulnerabilities and configuration issues
- [ ] Test for default or easily guessable passwords
- [ ] Test for insecure encrypted storage
- [ ] Test for inappropriate error handling
- [ ] Testing authentication and authorization failure
- [ ] Test CSRF
- [ ] Test SSRF
